The trunksync program synchronizes notes between the TrunkNotes app on an iOS device, and a computer.  The original code was provided by Matthew Kennard from [AppsOnTheMove](http://appsonthemove.com/trunk/trunk-sync-beta), and was released under a BSD Open Source licence. 

This modified version of the program includes a number of enhancements to make it easier to sync notes and images between a desktop and your iOS device.  

More details coming soon.
